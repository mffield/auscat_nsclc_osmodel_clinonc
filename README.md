# Federated learning survival model and potential radiotherapy decision support impact assessment for non-small cell lung cancer using real-world data. #

This is the code repository for the study:
"Federated learning survival model and potential radiotherapy decision support impact assessment for non-small cell lung cancer using real-world data" in Clinical Oncology 

The code developed in MATLAB utilised in this study analysis involving federated learning (FL) is contained in the folder "MATLAB_FL". It comprises a central algorithm script ("CentralLungDSS.m") which coordinates the FL and a local algorithm ("LocalLungModel.m") which runs on the infrastructure storing the data. This code is dependent on a functioning FL infrastructure utlilising the function in "Matlab_FL\@MPIservice" as described in Field et al. [2], [3], with code found here on Github: [AusCAT Federated Learning](https://github.com/mffield/auscat_federated_learning).

An addiitonal Python script is provided under the Python folder for validating the model. An example of a data set with dummy values is provided to demonstrate the script.
